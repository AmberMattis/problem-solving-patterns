    //1. Understand the Problem

    //The interviewer will paste a question on the screen, they'll read it to you, go over inputs and out puts
    //restate problem in your own words
    //identify inputs and outputs

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.


    /*
        1. restate: take the string, count the characters, return the count
        2. inputs: string, could be a sentence, alphanumeric characters (str)
        3. outputs: object with char as key and count as value, (charCount)

    */



    //2. Explore Concrete Examples

     // simple example:   countChars("aaaa") => {a : 4}
    //  complex example:  countChars("hello hey!") => {}

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.

    //
    /*

    //3. Break it Down

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.
        start with the output


    /*

	*/

   // function countChars(str){
        // make bucket obj
        // loop through string to get chars
        // check if char is alphanumeric
        //lowercase each char
        // if it is, add to obj
        // return obj
    //}
    //4. Solve || Simplify

    function countChars(str){
    let charCount = {};
    //for of loop
    for(let char of str){
        char = char.toLowerCase();

        //add char to new object
        if(!charCount[char]){
            charCount[char] = 1;

        }else{
            charCount[char] ++;

        }

    }

    //return obj
   return charCount;
    }

    console.log(countChars("hello from Texas!"));


    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.

    //5. Look Back and Refactor
    //if they ask if i can refactor
    // at the moment i can't think of a proper way to refactor however...

    //EX: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each alphanumeric character in the string.
